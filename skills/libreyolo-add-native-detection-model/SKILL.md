  Add a detection model to LibreYOLO. Covers both YOLO-grid families (YOLOX,
  YOLOv9, YOLO-NAS) and DETR-style families (RF-DETR, D-FINE; future RT-DETR).
  Includes the universal contract (BaseModel / BaseTrainer / TrainConfig /
  BaseValPreprocessor), the per-family integration patterns from real ports,
  and the trade-off LibreYOLO has explicitly made: best-in-class fine-tuning
  UX, not from-scratch paper-recipe reproduction.

# Adding a detection model to LibreYOLO

## 1. What LibreYOLO is

A single `LibreYOLO("Libre<Family><size>.pt")` factory dispatches to family-local
implementations. Each family lives entirely inside `libreyolo/models/<family>/`
and plugs into 4 shared ABCs. The factory iterates `BaseModel._registry` (auto-
populated via `__init_subclass__`) and the first `can_load(state_dict)` match wins.

```

## 2. Currently supported

| Family   | Sizes              | Paradigm | Native code | License (upstream) |
|----------|--------------------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| YOLOX    | n / t / s / m / l / x | YOLO-grid | yes        | Apache-2.0         |
| YOLOv9   | t / s / m / c      | YOLO-grid | yes         | MIT (`MultimediaTechLab/YOLO`) |
| YOLO-NAS | s / m / l          | YOLO-grid | yes         | Apache-2.0 (Deci CDN) |
| RF-DETR  | n / s / m / l      | DETR      | wrapper     | Apache-2.0         |
| D-FINE   | n / s / m / l / x  | DETR      | yes         | Apache-2.0         |

⚠️ **YOLOv9 license is *not* the same as the original paper repo.** LibreYOLO's
YOLOv9 port follows `MultimediaTechLab/YOLO` (MIT, by Kin-Yiu Wong and Hao-Tang Tsui),
**not** `WongKinYiu/yolov9` (GPL-3.0, the paper's reference implementation). When
you encounter a model with multiple upstream forks, check each — the permissive
fork is what makes integration into MIT-licensed LibreYOLO clean.

"Native code" means the model + loss + trainer live in `libreyolo/models/<family>/`.
"Wrapper" means the family delegates to a separate PyPI package (RF-DETR uses
`rfdetr` directly; the LibreYOLO code is mostly an adapter).

## 3. License check — do this first

LibreYOLO core is **MIT**, and the project explicitly tries to stay MIT-compatible.
Before porting anything, check **both** licenses on the upstream:

1. **The code** — read the upstream's `LICENSE` file (don't trust the README).
2. **The weights** — check the HuggingFace model card / release page / project site.
   Code and weights can have *different* licenses (e.g. Apache code + GPL weights, or
   permissive code + a custom commercial-restriction license on weights).

| Upstream license | Code in main? | Rehost weights under `LibreYOLO/` HF? | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD | ✅ | ✅ | normal integration; ship NOTICE per upload-hf-model skill |
| GPL-3.0 | ⚠️ ship as plugin only | ❌ never (forces GPL on users) | `libreyolo-<family>` separate package; user downloads weights from upstream |
| AGPL-3.0 | ⚠️ plugin only | ❌ never (network-use clause is broader) | same as GPL but stricter |
| Custom / non-redistributable | case-by-case | ❌ usually | link to upstream CDN, like YOLO-NAS does for Deci's bucket |

Code-license rationale: GPL is "viral" — putting GPL code inside MIT-licensed
LibreYOLO would force the entire library to become GPL, breaking every
downstream user who relies on MIT terms.

Weights-license rationale: the legal status of weights under GPL is unsettled,
but the conservative interpretation says any code that links a loaded GPL weight
becomes a combined work and inherits GPL on distribution. Don't expose users
to that without an explicit opt-in.

**Already-shipped examples**:
- D-FINE — Apache-2.0 code + Apache-2.0 weights → clean integration in core, weights rehosted on `LibreYOLO/LibreDFINE*`.
- RF-DETR — Apache-2.0 → clean.
- YOLOv9 — MIT code + MIT weights, via `MultimediaTechLab/YOLO` (Kin-Yiu Wong & Hao-Tang Tsui). Ported from the permissive fork, **not** `WongKinYiu/yolov9` (GPL-3.0).
- YOLO-NAS — Apache-2.0 code + custom Deci CDN for weights → linked rather than rehosted.
- YOLO-World — GPL-3.0 code + GPL-3.0 weights → flagged in #108; **plugin-only is the right call** even though wondervictor (paper first author) actively distributes.

When unsure, fetch the actual LICENSE file:

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repo>/<branch>/LICENSE | head -3
```

The first line is canonical. "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3" or
"GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3" → copyleft, treat carefully.
"MIT License" or "Apache License Version 2.0" → permissive, proceed.

For weights, check the HF model card YAML at the top:

```yaml
license: gpl-3.0    # ← copyleft
license: apache-2.0 # ← permissive
license: cc-by-nc-4.0 # ← non-commercial: usually a hard "no" for inclusion
```

## 4. The 4 ABCs every family plugs into

| ABC | File | Required overrides |
|---|---|---|
| `BaseModel` | `models/base/model.py` | `can_load`, `detect_size`, `detect_nb_classes`, `_init_model`, `_get_available_layers`, `_preprocess`, `_forward`, `_postprocess`, `_get_preprocess_numpy` |
| `BaseTrainer` | `training/trainer.py` | `_config_class`, `get_model_family`, `get_model_tag`, `create_transforms`, `create_scheduler`, `get_loss_components` |
| `TrainConfig` | `training/config.py` | dataclass subclass with `kw_only=True`, override only fields that differ |
| `BaseValPreprocessor` | `validation/preprocessors.py` | `__call__`, `normalize`, optionally `uses_letterbox` and `custom_normalization` |

Auto-registration kicks in on import: `models/__init__.py` adds one line per
family. **Import order = `can_load` priority** when heuristics overlap.

## 5. Two architectural patterns

Pick one. The contracts diverge non-trivially.

### YOLO-grid pattern (YOLOX, YOLOv9, YOLO-NAS)

- Model output: single dense tensor per scale, e.g. `(B, 4+nc, N)` (xyxy + class scores).
- Training targets: `(B, max_labels, 5)` padded `[class, cx, cy, w, h]` pixel coords.
- Loss: per-anchor + assignment (SimOTA / TaskAlignedAssigner / DFL).
- Augmentation: numpy/cv2, mosaic + mixup central. Lives in `training/augment.py`
  (`MosaicMixupDataset`, `random_affine`, etc.) — reused across YOLO families.
- ONNX: 1 output named `"output"`, opset 13 default works.
- Detection head exposes `self.export: bool` flipped by the exporter at
  `export/exporter.py:_model_context`.
- NCNN / OpenVINO / TensorRT / TorchScript all work out of the box.

### DETR pattern (RF-DETR, D-FINE; future RT-DETR)

- Model output: dict `{"pred_logits": (B, Q, nc), "pred_boxes": (B, Q, 4)}` cxcywh in [0, 1].
- Training targets: `list[dict{labels, boxes_cxcywh_normalized}]` per image — no padding.
- Loss: Hungarian matching + auxiliary outputs across decoder layers (FGL, GO-LSD for D-FINE).
- Augmentation: torchvision v2 transforms with `tv_tensors.Image` + `tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes`.
- Multi-scale: per-batch random resize via a custom collate (`BatchImageCollateFunction`-style).
- Backbone LR multiplier (0.1× or 0.5×) is standard. Implies per-group LR application
  in `_train_epoch` — needs to be overridden, hooks aren't enough.
- Gradient clipping (`max_norm=0.1`) is standard.
- ONNX: 2 outputs `["pred_logits", "pred_boxes"]`, opset ≥ 16 (for `grid_sample`).
- Export wrapper: a small `nn.Module` that calls `model.deploy()` (recursive
  `convert_to_deploy` on every submodule that defines it) and flattens dict→tuple.
- **NCNN does not work** for DETR-family models — its op registry lacks `topk`.
- EMA mid-training decay change (`set_decay`) is sometimes used to stabilize the
  final phase after augmentation stops.

## 6. The training-recipe trade-off (read this before claiming a port is "done")

LibreYOLO has explicitly chosen **not to reproduce upstream paper recipes for
from-scratch training**. From-scratch reproduction would require sponsoring
hundreds of GPU-hours per family and matching every augmentation, EMA quirk,
loss weight, and warmup detail. That's not what 99% of users want.

What LibreYOLO *does* aim for:

1. **Inference parity** — bit-equivalent outputs vs. upstream on the released
   checkpoints. This is non-negotiable.
2. **Best-possible fine-tuning** — a user can load the upstream pretrained
   checkpoint and fine-tune on a small custom dataset, getting within ~1 mAP of
   what `python -m upstream.train ...` would have produced.

Concretely, this means **every existing family has gaps relative to its upstream
training recipe**, and that's by design. Examples we've already accepted:

- D-FINE skips Objects365 pretraining (not relevant for fine-tune users).
- D-FINE used to skip `RandomZoomOut` / `RandomIoUCrop` / `RandomPhotometricDistort`
  in v1 (added in a later commit, ~+1.5 mAP gain).
- YOLOv9 doesn't ship the auxiliary "branch" head used during from-scratch training.
- YOLO-NAS uses LibreYOLO's letterbox preprocessing (close but not identical to
  SuperGradients' exact pipeline) — documented as a known parity gap.

**When you port a new model**:

1. **Spend agentic time reading the upstream training code first.** The model's
   forward pass is the easy 30%. Augmentations, optimizer param groups, LR
   schedule shape, EMA dynamics, multi-scale collation, gradient clipping —
   that's the other 70%, and it dominates fine-tune quality.
2. **Decide explicitly which pieces you skip.** Document them in a commit
   message or in the family's docstring.
3. **Aim for fine-tune parity, not paper parity.** Test by loading upstream
   weights, fine-tuning on `coco128` or `marbles` for ~10 epochs, and verifying
   mAP improves.
4. **Don't pretend gaps don't exist.** If the augmentation chain is half what
   upstream uses, say so. A 5-line `transforms.py` that says "TODO: port
   `RandomZoomOut`" is more honest than silently shipping a degraded recipe.

A useful agent prompt:
*"In `<upstream-repo>/`, identify every augmentation, loss weight, optimizer
param group, LR schedule, and EMA behavior used during training. Output a
concrete checklist of what would need to be ported."*

## 7. Per-family integration: what each one actually shipped

### YOLOX (`models/yolox/`)
- Files: `__init__.py`, `model.py`, `nn.py`, `trainer.py`, `utils.py`, `loss.py` (6 files).
- Pattern: YOLO-grid. Pixel cxcywh targets, BGR 0–255 inference, letterbox preprocessing.
- Augmentations: reuses shared `libreyolo/training/augment.py` (mosaic + mixup); no family-local `transforms.py`.
- Recipe gaps: minimal. Closest to upstream of any family.

### YOLOv9 (`models/yolo9/`)
- Files: 7 files. Largest port (~2.3k LoC) due to ELAN/RepNCSPELAN modules.
- Pattern: YOLO-grid. RGB 0–1 inference, letterbox.
- Recipe gaps: from-scratch auxiliary head dropped; mixup disabled; single LR group instead of upstream's 3.

### YOLO-NAS (`models/yolonas/`)
- Files: 7 files. Native nn but state-dict-compatible with SuperGradients' SG checkpoints.
- Pattern: YOLO-grid.
- Recipe gaps: SG's exact augmentation pipeline replaced by LibreYOLO's standard letterbox path (documented).
- Quirks: weights download from Deci's CDN, not LibreYOLO's HF org (license).

### RF-DETR (`models/rfdetr/`)
- Files: 5 files (`__init__.py`, `model.py`, `nn.py`, `trainer.py`, `utils.py`).
- Pattern: DETR. **Wrapper, not native** — delegates to the `rfdetr` PyPI package.
- Trainer subprocess-isolated to avoid CUDA driver corruption.
- Recipe gaps: training is upstream's, so few. Inference path adapts upstream's
  postprocessor (cxcywh → xyxy, COCO 91→80 class remap).

### D-FINE (`models/dfine/`)
- Files: 16 files. Largest port (~4k LoC).
  - Architecture: `nn.py`, `backbone.py`, `encoder.py`, `decoder.py`, `common.py`, `ms_deform.py`
  - Numerical core: `fdr.py` (FDR math, separately parity-tested), `box_ops.py`
  - Loss: `loss.py`, `matcher.py`, `denoising.py`
  - Wrapper + IO: `model.py`, `utils.py`, `transforms.py`, `trainer.py`
- Pattern: DETR.
- Recipe gaps: from-scratch HGNetV2 pretrained backbone download disabled (users start
  from D-FINE's own COCO/obj2coco checkpoints). Backbone-LR multiplier added in v2.
  Fine-tune now closely matches upstream's recipe.

### Files-touched matrix (universal centralizing files)

Every family edits these:

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| `libreyolo/models/<family>/{__init__.py, model.py, nn.py, trainer.py, utils.py}` | family-local code |
| `libreyolo/models/__init__.py` | one-line family import (drives auto-registration order) |
| `libreyolo/__init__.py` | `LibreYOLO<Family>` export + `__all__` |
| `libreyolo/training/config.py` | append `<Family>Config(TrainConfig)` |
| `libreyolo/validation/preprocessors.py` | append `<Family>ValPreprocessor` |
| `weights/convert_<family>_weights.py` | one-shot CLI that wraps the upstream checkpoint with LibreYOLO metadata (`model_family`, `size`, `nc`, `names`) so the unified factory can route it without filename heuristics |
| `tests/unit/test_<family>_*.py` | parity / shape / loss / smoke tests against upstream — done before claiming inference is correct |
| `tests/e2e/conftest.py` | append rows to `MODEL_CATALOG` |

Conditional edits depending on family:

| File | When |
|---|---|
| `libreyolo/models/<family>/loss.py` | non-trivial loss (everyone except RF-DETR) |
| `libreyolo/models/<family>/transforms.py` | augmentation diverges from the shared `training/augment.py` mosaic+mixup default (D-FINE adds tv2-based ops; YOLOv9 / YOLO-NAS subclass) |
| `libreyolo/training/scheduler.py` | paper recipe needs an LR shape that doesn't exist yet — e.g. D-FINE added `FlatCosineScheduler` (warmup → flat → cosine tail). Add a new generic `BaseScheduler` subclass; do **not** put schedulers under `models/<family>/` |
| `libreyolo/training/ema.py` | EMA decay needs to change at runtime (e.g. mid-train restart). D-FINE added `set_decay(decay, ramp=False)` — generic enough to leave shared |
| `libreyolo/backends/base.py` | output shape diverges from YOLO grid (DETR families need it) |
| `libreyolo/backends/tensorrt.py` | output names differ from `"output"` (DETR families) |
| `libreyolo/export/exporter.py` | needs an `_model_context` branch (D-FINE has one for the deploy wrapper) |
| `libreyolo/export/onnx.py` | output count differs from 1 or 3 (DETR's 2-output case) |
| `pyproject.toml` | **mandatory for wrapper integrations** (RF-DETR's `[rfdetr]` extra is required, not optional — the wrapper is non-functional without the dep). For native ports, only if you genuinely can't avoid a new dep. |

## 8. The integration-proof tests

You're integrated when both pass for every size of your family.

| Test | What it proves | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/e2e/test_val_coco128.py` | Inference loads + runs; preprocessing + class mapping + postprocessing are correct. | Runs `model.val(data="coco128.yaml")`, asserts mAP50-95 ≥ 0.18. |
| `tests/e2e/test_rf1_training.py` | Training improves the model on a real dataset (marbles). | Trains 10 epochs, asserts post-mAP > pre-mAP and post-mAP ≥ 0.05. |

To wire your family into both: append rows to `MODEL_CATALOG` in
`tests/e2e/conftest.py`. Both tests parametrize over the catalog.

**DETR families**: skip the `last_loss < first_loss` assertion in `test_rf1_training`.
DETR total loss is the sum of ~38 weighted aux terms (per-decoder-layer + pre +
encoder-aux + DN paths) and is too noisy on small datasets for monotonic-decrease
to be reliable. RF-DETR's branch and the D-FINE branch both exempt themselves.

## 9. Silent-corruption landmines (in priority order)

The ones below have actually burned integrations in this repo. Each line is a one-shot:
*[which family hit it]* — what to do.

1. **Color space mismatch between training transform and val preprocessor**
   *(YOLOX BGR vs YOLOv9 RGB)* — pin the convention in both docstrings, cross-check.
2. **Target format mismatch** *(D-FINE)* — DETR criteria want `list[dict]` but the
   data pipeline yields padded `(B, max_labels, 5)`; translate in `on_forward`.
3. **`can_load()` too greedy** *(RF-DETR almost stole D-FINE checkpoints)* — match
   on tokens unique to your architecture; never `"backbone"` or `"weight"`.
4. **Backbone LR multiplier missing** *(DETR families)* — silent ~0.5 mAP loss in
   fine-tuning. Implies per-group LR + `_train_epoch` override.
5. **Multi-scale collate epoch propagation** *(D-FINE)* — collate needs `set_epoch()`
   called from the trainer at each epoch start.
6. **Stop-epoch augmentation policy** *(D-FINE)* — disable `RandomZoomOut`/`RandomIoUCrop`
   etc. at epoch N. Different from `no_aug_epochs` (which kills mosaic for last N).
7. **`labels_getter=lambda` is unpicklable** under Python 3.14's `forkserver`
   *(D-FINE on macOS)* — use a module-level function for `SanitizeBoundingBoxes`.
8. **`RandomIoUCrop` has no `p` parameter** in torchvision v2 — wrap with `RandomApply`.
9. **MPS-specific torch bugs in DETR backward** *(D-FINE)* — provide a `_setup_device`
   override that falls back to CPU; CUDA path stays unchanged.
10. **Post-train device drift** *(D-FINE)* — when the trainer fell back to CPU, the
    wrapper's `self.device` is still MPS; `model.val()` after `model.train()` hits
    a device mismatch. End `train()` with `self.model.to(self.device)`.
11. **ONNX opset 13 default** — DETR families with deformable attention need ≥ 16.
    Set per-family default in `BaseExporter.__call__`.
12. **NCNN can't handle DETR ops** *(D-FINE)* — block the export early with
    `NotImplementedError` instead of producing a graph the runtime can't load.
13. **`head.export` flag missing** *(YOLO-grid families)* — without it, ONNX bakes
    static shapes that work only at the exact resolution exported.
14. **`strict=True` state-dict loading** — override `_strict_loading() = False` if
    upstream checkpoints carry EMA buffers, profiling state, or auxiliary heads.
15. **Cross-family rejection on cross-family transfer** — when intentionally
    splicing weights, pop `model_family` from the donor checkpoint dict.
16. **EMA decay too low** — if you lower it from 0.9999 without good reason,
    early-epoch evals show flat or decreasing mAP because the EMA hasn't settled.
17. **Letterbox vs. plain resize** — `uses_letterbox` property must match the
    training transform; `DetectionValidator` reads it for target rescaling.
18. **`_train_epoch` override drift** *(DETR families)* — when you copy the parent
    loop to add per-group LR + grad clip + epoch propagation, leave a comment
    "kept in sync with `BaseTrainer._train_epoch` as of <commit>" so drift is
    auditable. Promote to shared hooks if a third family needs the same overrides.

## 10. Workflow

1. **Check both licenses** — code (upstream `LICENSE` file) and weights
   (HF model card). If either is GPL/AGPL, plan for a plugin-only ship; if
   weights are non-redistributable, link to the upstream CDN like YOLO-NAS.
2. **Pick the pattern**: YOLO-grid or DETR. Skim the existing family that's closest.
3. **Audit upstream's training recipe** with an agent. Decide what you skip.
4. **Implement family-local code** (`models/<family>/`) — the model, postprocess,
   and inference wrapper first. Verify byte-equivalent inference parity vs upstream.
5. **Wire central files** — `models/__init__.py`, `__init__.py`, `config.py`,
   `validation/preprocessors.py`. Family must load via `LibreYOLO("Libre<Family>s.pt")`.
6. **Implement the trainer** — `trainer.py`, `transforms.py`, `loss.py`. Verify
   the loss matches upstream on synthetic inputs (parity test, 1e-5 tolerance).
7. **Wire into `MODEL_CATALOG`** and run `test_val_coco128` + `test_rf1_training`.
8. **Test ONNX export** at minimum. If the rest of the export formats are family-
   compatible, run them too.
9. **Upload weights to HuggingFace** under `LibreYOLO/Libre<Family><size>/` —
   see the separate `libreyolo-upload-hf-model` skill (skip if upstream license
   forbids redistribution; link to upstream CDN instead).
